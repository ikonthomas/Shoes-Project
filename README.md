# Shoes-Project.
A client would like to open a shoe store and we are in the process of helping with this start-up and for this purpose we have obtained the following dataset (shoes_data.csv). This is a list of women's shoes and their associated information. Each shoe will have an entry for each price found for it, so a single shoe may have multiple entries. Data includes shoe name, brand, price, and more. We are unsure of what this data could mean but we would like you to investigate the following: This data provides a lot of information, which means you can pull out a lot of different trends.
